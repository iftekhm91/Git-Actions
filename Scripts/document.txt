This document outlines the GitHub CI/CD solution designed specifically for automating the deployment of AWS resources using CloudFormation templates. Utilizing GitHub Actions, this solution streamlines the process of creating, updating, and managing AWS infrastructure across distinct environments: npd, nft, and prd. The architecture is tailored to ensure efficient deployment through a series of scripts and a structured directory layout, enabling the team to execute infrastructure changes reliably and with minimal manual effort. Key components include a well-defined workflow for creating changesets and deploying resources, which enhances the overall deployment process while maintaining clarity and control.
